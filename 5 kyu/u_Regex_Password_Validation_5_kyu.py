# You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

# At least six characters long
# contains a lowercase letter
# contains an uppercase letter
# contains a digit
# only contains alphanumeric characters (note that '_' is not alphanumeric)


# regex="^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])[a-zA-Z\d]{6,}$"
